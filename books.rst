Entropy
======
**NOTE:** books primarily focused on entropy

* Alekseev, G.N. (1986). `Energy and Entropy`_. Moscow: Mir Publishers.

  * You can get it from `archive.org <https://archive.org/details/EnergyAndEntropy>`_
  * "This book outlines the **history** of the formulation of these two notions." [EnergyAndEntropy_Archive]_
  
* Ben-Naim, A. (2010) `Discover Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics: A Playful Way of Discovering a Law of Nature`_. World Scientific.

  * This is a sequel to the author's book entitled *Entropy Demystified* (2007).
  
* Dugdale, J. S. (1996). `Entropy and its Physical Meaning`_. Taylor & Francis.

  * "This text gives students a clear and easily understood introduction to entropy - a central 
    concept in thermodynamics, but one which is often regarded as the most difficult to grasp." [EntropyPhysicalMeaning_Amazon]_

* Leff, H.S. (2020). Energy and Entropy: A Dynamic Duo (1st ed.). CRC Press.

  * "The primary goal of this book is to illuminate energy and entropy, the two pillars of thermodynamics, and to clarify 
    their essential linkage." [EnergyEntropyDynamicDuo]_

* Lemons, D. (2013). `A Student's Guide to Entropy (Student's Guides)`_. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.

  * "Striving to explore the subject in as simple a manner as possible, this book helps readers understand the elusive concept 
    of entropy." [StudentsGuideEntropy_Amazon]_

Thermodynamics
==============
Non-technical texts
-------------------
* Goldstein, M. & Inge F. (1993). *The Refrigerator and the Universe*. Harvard University Press. 

  * You can borrow it from `archive.org <https://archive.org/details/refrigeratoruniv0000gold>`_
  * "A nontechnical introduction, good on historical and interpretive matters." [RefrigeratorUniv_Wikipedia]_
  
Undergraduate texts
-------------------
* Lee, J. C. (2002). *Thermal physics: entropy and free energies* (2nd ed.). World Scientific. 

  * "This book can be used as a supplementary textbook, or preferably, even before taking the course, as an introduction" [ThermalPhysics]_
