Entropy
======
**NOTE:** books primarily focused on entropy

* Alekseev, G.N. (1986). *Energy and Entropy*. Moscow: Mir Publishers.

  * You can get it from `archive.org <https://archive.org/details/EnergyAndEntropy>`_
  * "This book outlines the **history** of the formulation of these two notions." [EnergyAndEntropy]_
  
* Ben-Naim, Arieh. (2010) `Discover Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics: A Playful Way of Discovering a
Law of Nature`_. World Scientific.

  * This is a sequel to the author's book entitled *Entropy Demystified* (Published by World Scientific, 2007).
  
* Dugdale, J. S. (1996). `Entropy and its Physical Meaning`_. Taylor & Francis.

  * "This text gives students a clear and easily understood introduction to entropy - a central 
    concept in thermodynamics, but one which is often regarded as the most difficult to grasp." [EntropyPhysicalMeaning]_
